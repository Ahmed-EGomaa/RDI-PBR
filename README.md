Welcome to the RDI PhotoBioreactor project! This Do-It-Yourself (DIY) microalgae bioreactor is designed to facilitate the evolution of microalgae cells under harsh conditions. The reactor incorporates advanced features such as image recognition based on AI models, real-time monitoring of cellular stress, chemostatic control through cooling and stirring, as well as color sensing capabilities using a camera module. This cost-effective solution is specifically tailored for microbial adaptive evolution studies.

## Features

### 1. **AI Image Recognition:**
   - The RDI PhotoBioreactor is equipped with an advanced AI model for image recognition.
   - The AI model distinguishes between stressed and healthy microalgae cells.
   - Real-time analysis provides insights into the stress levels that the cells are undergoing.

### 2. **Chemostatic Control:**
   - The reactor ensures precise control of environmental conditions through chemostatic regulation.
   - Cooling and stirring mechanisms maintain optimal conditions for the microalgae cells.

### 3. **Color Sensing:**
   - A built-in color sensing system enables the monitoring of changes in cell pigmentation.
   - This feature allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to stress.

### 4. **Camera Module:**
   - The integrated camera module captures images for the AI model and provides a visual record of experiments.
   - High-quality images aid in the detailed analysis of cellular morphology and health.

### 5. **Microbial Adaptive Evolution:**
   - The RDI PhotoBioreactor is specifically designed to support studies in microbial adaptive evolution.
   - Users can explore and understand how microalgae cells adapt and evolve under various stress conditions.
